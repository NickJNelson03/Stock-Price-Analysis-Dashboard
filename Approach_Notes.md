## Technical Implementation Plan

### Add Technical Indicators to fetch_data.py

Start with Simple Moving Averages (SMA): Calculate 10-day and 50-day SMA.

Add Exponential Moving Average (EMA): Implement 20-day EMA.

Include Relative Strength Index (RSI): Calculate 14-day RSI for overbought/oversold signals.

## Enhance Data Visualization

Plot stock prices along with SMA and EMA indicators.

Add RSI as a subplot for better clarity.
